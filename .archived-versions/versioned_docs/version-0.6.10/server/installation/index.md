title: Starwhale Server Installation Guide
---

Starwhale Server is delivered as a Docker image, which can be run with Docker directly or deployed to a Kubernetes cluster or Minikube.

* If you plan to quickly experience Starwhale Server functions in a standalone environment, you can use the `swcli server start` command to [start Starwhale Server with one click](server-start).
* If you plan to use Starwhale Server in a production environment, you can use Kubernetes to achieve production-level deployment. See [Installing Starwhale in a Kubernetes Cluster](k8s-cluster).  
* If you plan to deploy Starwhale Server using [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), see [Installing Starwhale in Minikube](minikube).
* If you plan to host Starwhale Server in Docker separately and submit tasks to the Kubernetes cluster, see [Installing Starwhale Server with Docker](docker).
