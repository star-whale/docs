title: How to Organize and Manage Resources with Starwhale Projects
---

Project is the basic unit for organizing and managing resources (such as models, datasets, runtime environments, etc.). You can create and manage projects based on your needs. For example, you can create projects by business team, product line, or models. One user can create and participate in one or more projects.

## Project type

There are two types of projectsï¼š

- **Private project**: The project (and related resources in the project) is only visible to project members with permission. Project members can view or edit the project (as well as associated resources in the project). For more information on roles, please take a look at [Roles and permissions in Starwhale](roles-permissions).

- **Public project**: The project (and related resources in the project) is visible to all Starwhale users. Project members can view or edit the project (as well as associated resources in the project). For more information on roles, please take a look at [Roles and permissions in Starwhale](roles-permissions).
